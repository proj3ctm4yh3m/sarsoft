<h2>Backcountry Mapping Evolved</h2>

<p>
There are two versions of sarsoft, both of which are free for SAR use.  This version is open source but lacks some advanced
features like PDF generation and KMZ exports.  For a fully featured version, or to get map data for your response area,
email Matt Jacobs, Bay Area Mountain Rescue, at <a href="mailto:info@caltopo.com">info@caltopo.com</a>.
