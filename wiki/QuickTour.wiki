= Terminology =

Before using sarsoft, it helps to have a basic understanding of the terminology involved.  If you have prior search experience, this should be familiar.  Each *search* is composed of distinct periods of time called *operational periods*, which typically correspond to changes in the overhead team, searchers, etc.  For each operational period, the *plans* section writes a number of *search assignments*, which are assigned personnel by the *operations* section.

= Maps =

When you're operating in unfamiliar terrain, it can be difficult to wrap your head around what the surrounding environment looks like, and how your assignments fit in with that terrain.  In order to address this, Sarsoft places a heavy emphasis on mapping.  In addition to overlaying the same set of data on different map types (topo, satellite, street, etc), Sarsoft also allows you to blend map types together.  This allows you to provide relief shading on satellite imagery, overlay park trails on a USGS topo, etc.  To see an example of this without downloading Sarsoft, you can visit http://mattj.net/overlaymap.html.

= Screens =

The Sarsoft plans module has the following primary pages:

 * Operational Period List View: Lists all operational periods.
 * Operational Period Detail View: Sortable list of all search assignments within an operation.
 * Operational Period Map View: Map-based view of all assignments within an operational period.
 * Assignment Detail Page: Details of an individual search assignment.

=== Operational Period Detail ===

The operational period detail view provides a sortable list of all assignments within an operational period.  Most of the heavy lifting is done from the map view; however, you can also export the operational period to Google Earth:

=== Operational Period Map View ===

The operational period map shows all assignments within an operational period, laid out on a map.  You can add and delete assignments, change assignment boundaries, etc. by right-clicking on the map:

By swapping between map backgrounds, you can also see how the assignment fits in with surrounding terrain.  The view above shows a background from OpenStreetMap, which has park trails marked on it.  Below is the same set of assignments overlaid on satellite imagery, a USGS map, and an OpenStreetMap/satellite hybrid:

When you right-click an assignment and select "Edit Bounds", the corners of the assignment boundary become draggable.  You can introduce new corners by clicking on the mid-points of lines:

You can color the assignment boundaries by aspects like resource type and POD, switch between opaque polygons and lines, decide whether to overlay previous operational periods and more by right-clicking on an empty part of the map and selecting "Map Setup":

=== Assignment Detail ===

The assignment detail view lets you edit the details of the assignment, decide which map types to print with the assignment, and download tracks:
