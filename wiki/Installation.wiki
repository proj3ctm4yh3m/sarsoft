#summary Installing and running Sarsoft.

= Installation =

Sarsoft is packaged as a JAR file; all you need to run it is Java 6.

 * Download the jar file at <a href="http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.4.jar">http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.4.jar</a>.

 * Start the jar file by typing `java -jar sarsoft-0.4.jar` at the command line or double-clicking the file in the windows file explorer.

 * Point your browser at http://localhost:8080 to access Sarsoft.

 * Working data will be placed in a folder named `.sarsoft`, in the directory you start the .jar file from.

 * If you want to use user-supplied georeferenced imagery, it is recommended that you increase the memory available to the JVM, e.g. by using `java -Xmx256M -jar sarsoft-0.4.jar` with the Sun JVM.

= Configuration =

Sarsoft is ready to use out of the box, with no external dependencies or configuration required.  You can customize it by passing arguments via a `sarsoft.properties` file in the directory you start the application from.  This is a standard Java key=value properties file.

=== Database ===

Sarsoft's default database is HSQL, which is an in-memory/filesystem database embedded within the application.  You can use a different database (MySQL is the only one which has been tested) using the following parameters:

{{{
hibernate.driverClass=[org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver | com.mysql.jdbc.Driver | etc ]
hibernate.jdbcUrl=jdbc:mysql:://hostname/dbname
hibernate.username=your username
hibernate.password=your password
hibernate.dialect=[org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect | org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect | etc ]
}}}

=== Map Viewer ===

Sarsoft comes with an embedded copy of the OpenLayers map viewer, which can be used offline when no internet connection is available.  It also supports Google Maps, which allows you to use Google's map background tiles.  OpenLayers is the default; you can switch to Google using

{{{
sarsoft.map.viewer=google
}}}

By default, Sarsoft will cache most map background tiles and serve them to other web clients.  This reduces network load in a bandwidth-constrained environment, but can be slower when a full internet connection is available.  You can disable this using

{{{
sarsoft.map.tileCacheEnabled=false
}}}

Sarsoft also allows users to upload images, align them, and then use them as map backgrounds (georeferenced imagery).  Manipulating the image in Java uses a lot of memory; in memory-constrained environments you can disable this feature using

{{{
sarsoft.map.imageUploadEnabled=false
}}}

The default map for new searches covers the US.  You can customize Sarsoft to your location by specifying a latitude, longitude and zoom level.

{{{
sarsoft.map.default.zoom=5
sarsoft.map.default.lat=38
sarsoft.map.default.lng=-97
}}}
