#Installation guide

= Installation =

 * Download the zip file at <a href="http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.1.zip">http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.1.zip</a>.  You may need to unzip the file once it's downloaded.

 *  The unzipped folder will be named "sarsoft".  Opening this in a file browser, you should see a folder named config and a file named sar.jar.  On Windows and Mac systems with Java installed, you should be able to double-click on the sar.jar file to run it.

 * Point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.  You will see a landing page with a list of existing searches; enter a new search name and click *create*.

= Creating a First Assignment =

 * Click *View assignments in a map* to create a new assignment.

 * You'll see a map of the entire US, in Google's Terrain background.  Zoom in on the search area, and select the most appropriate background from the controls in the upper right.  Right-click on the map and choose *Make this map background default for search*.

 * Right-click on the map and choose *New Search Assignment*.

 * You'll see a colored square on the map representing the assignment.  Right-click on this square and select *Edit Assignment Bounds*.

 * The corners of the square will become draggable.  Drag it to form an outline for the assignment.  Right-click on the polygon and select *Save Changes*.

 * Select a different map background using the controls in the upper right.  Right-click on the colored polygon representing your new assignment and select *Attach this map to assignment*.  Each backround you attach will be automatically printed with the assignment.

 * Right-click on the polygon again, and select *View Assignment Details*.
<img src="http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/install-viewdetails.png"/>

 * The assignment details page will open in either a new tab or new window.  Mark the assignment as prepared (this will prevent anyone from editing its boundaries like you just did above) by clicking *Prepare Assignment*, entering your name, and clicking *Prepare*.
<img src="http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/install-prepare.png"/>

 * The Prepare Assignment link will be replaced with a *Print Assignment* link.  Click this to print the assignment.  Printing will open another window/tab; when all the map backgrounds have been downloaded, your browser's print dialog should automatically appear.  Several copies of a form designed to mirror <a href="http://www.basarc.org">BASARC's</a> SAR 104 form will be printed, along with the attached map backgrounds.

= Shutting Down =

 * Unless you start the application from a command line, it will run windowless - there's no obvious way to kill it without looking at a process list.  You can shutdown the sarsoft app by going to the homepage (click the big SARSOFT in the upper left hand corner) and clicking *Administration Console*.  Under the Server Control tab, click *Shut Down*.
