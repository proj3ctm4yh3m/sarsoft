#summary Installing and running Sarsoft.

= Installation =

Starting with version 0.3, sarsoft is packaged as a simple .jar file.

 * Download the zip file at <a href="http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.3.jar">http://sarsoft.googlecode.com/files/sarsoft-0.3.jar</a>.

 * On Windows and Mac systems with Java installed, you should be able to double-click on the sarsoft-0.3.jar file to start the application.  Sarsoft will create two folders in the directory from which it's started: config and hsqldb.

 * Point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.  You will see a landing page with a list of existing searches; enter a new search name and click *create*.

 * Click on "Site Admin".

 * Select the "Map Configuration" tab and click on the "clicking here" link at the bottom of the table to populate the default map configurations.

 * If you plan on accessing Sarsoft from a machine other than the one it's running on, select the "API Keys" tab and enter your hostname and Google Maps and Garmin API keys.

You can password protect this page by starting Sarsoft on the command line and specifying a password as follows: java -Dsarsoft.admin.password=mypassword -jar sarsoft-0.3.jar

= Shutting Down =

 * Unless you start the application from a command line, it will run windowless - there's no obvious way to kill it without looking at a process list.  You can shutdown the sarsoft app by going to the homepage (click the big SARSOFT in the upper left hand corner) and clicking *Administration Console*.  Under the Server Control tab, click *Shut Down*.
