= Version 0.5 =

==Major changes for 0.5==
  * Redid resource pages so that people and equipment could be imported/exported as CSV files.
  * Redid location tracking to use APRS tier2 servers & physically attached TNCs. 
  * Routed all errors to log4j rather than console.
  * Support for NAD27 datum.
  * Added CP & PLS waypoints to search map.

==Minor changes for 0.5==
  * Download LKP, PLS and CP to GPS devices along with search assignment.
  * Auto print attached resources with SAR 104 forms.
  * Improved UTM gridline labels and gridline spacing for large maps.
  * Print tracks as a different color than assignment on debrief maps.
  * Standalone map page for viewing/printing a blank map without creating an assignment.

==Migration instructions for 0.5==
The resource / location tracking database tables were entirely rewritten, and Hibernate will get confused if 0.5 is run against the old table structure.  You can keep your old database (minus location information) by deleting these tables, but no official migration script will be provided.  It's recommended that you back up searches to .gpx, delete the database, and then reimport searches.
