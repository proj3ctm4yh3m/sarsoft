#summary Printing Large Maps for the CP

= Printing Large Maps =

On large searches, it's common to need to dump a map of the search area onto a 30x40 plotter.  Sarsoft supports this, although the feature is somewhat hidden.

On the operational period map view page ("Current Operations: Map" from the homepage), right-click on the map background and select "Adjust page size for printing".  The current size is 100% of the browser window for both width and height; you should adjust this to your page size in inches *minus a margin, typically .5in to .7in on each side*.  HTML printing behavior can vary widely from browser; when you print an individual assignment, Sarsoft is conservative about the amount of space it uses in order to ensure compatibility over a wide range of printers and browsers.  When printing a large map, you can take some extra time to get things dialed.  Some things to keep in mind:

 * Check whether your browser has a "scale to fit" option.  This allows you to be less precise choosing the width and height, as your browser will grow or shrink the map to fit the page.  If your sizes are wildly off, you will still wind up with an ugly map.

 * Run through multiple print preview cycles in order to get the dimensions dialed.  If your browser isn't scaling the page to fit, being a fraction of an inch over the page size (minus margins) can cause the browser to spit out a second, mostly blank 30x40 sheet.  It can also cause the UTM easting labels to get cropped off the page.

 * The quality of the print you get will be heavily dependent on the quality of the map background tiles.  Some of the tile layers are web-optimized and can look grainy or blurry when printed.

 * Sarsoft will not recenter or rezoom when you resize the page; you'll need to do this manually.

== Customizing Map Features ==

Except for the pan/zoom/layer controls, everything you see on the map will print with it.  This is a good time to get acquainted with the Map Setup dialog you can access by right-clicking on them map, so that you can control how the map looks when it prints.

For both the current and previous operational periods, the map setup dialog allows you to control the following:

 * _Show_.  You can print all assignments, or print separate maps showing just ground, dog or OHV assignments.
 * _Color By_.  The color of the assignment segment.  The actual colors are hard-coded, but you can choose to color by assignment number (the default) or by an attribute of each assignment so that, e.g., it's easy to differentiate dog v. ground assignments by color.  Disabled sets all assignments to black.
 * _Line Opacity_.  You generally want to set this to 100% for printing.
 * _Fill Opacity_.  The opacity used to fill assignment polygons.  Settings to to 0 causes only the assignment bounds to be drawn, so that you can more clearly see the map background.
 * _Show Tracks_.  Whether or not show uploaded tracks.

Additionally, you can clutter or declutter the map by setting:

 * _Label Tracks & Waypoints._  Causes waypoints to show up on the map for all uploaded tracks and waypoints.  These come directly from the GPS unit and don't have any team designation unless it was entered into the GPS.
 * _Show/Hide Previous Operational Periods._  Part of the right-click menu and not the map setup dialog, this allows you to hide all segments and tracks from previous operational periods for a cleaner map.
