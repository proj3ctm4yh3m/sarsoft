#summary Introduction to sarsoft.

= Origins =

Sarsoft grew out of frustration with the existing tools available for search management.  If you've ever tried matching up a park trails map with a USGS topo in unfamiliar terrain at 2AM, struggled to read someone's chicken scratch on the 3rd carbon copy of a form or walked in circles trying to figure out where your assignment boundary is, you'll understand some of the shortcomings that sarsoft was designed to address.

The sarsoft "mission statement" is to *provide increased efficiency and situational awareness on search operations*.

= Philosophy =

The main design goals of sarsoft are as follows:
 * Deploy and run locally, with minimal configuration.
 * Work within (rather than replace) paper-based systems.
 * Intuitive to new users with search overhead experience.

= Deployment =

You can run the sarsoft jar file as a local application without any further steps.  On an actual search, you'll probably want to set your network up so that multiple machines can access the application at the same time - an overhead projector for the room, plan writers, a station for uploading and downloading GPS data, etc.  In order to do this, you'll need to set your local network up so that the machine running sarsoft is identified by a unique machine name, and obtain an google maps API key for that name.  You can update the google maps key through the sarsoft admin console.

You should back your work up frequently.  You can do this in 3 ways:
 * Copy the hsqldb folder.
 * Export operational periods to GPX or KML files and save them on a local machine.
 * Backup to hard copy!  Print your assignments out as soon as they're ready.

= Status =

Sarsoft is currently in active development and not production ready.  You are encouraged to use it in trainings and mock searches and submit feedback and bug reports, but should not count on it for live searches.
