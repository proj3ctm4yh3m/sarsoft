#summary The basic steps required to write plans.


= Terminology =

If you have prior search planning experience, the terminology sarsoft uses should be familiar.  Each *search* is comprised of distinct time periods called *operational periods*, which typically correspond to changes in the overhead team, searchers, etc.  For each operational period, the *plans* section writes a number of *search assignments*, which are assigned to personnel by the *operations* section.

This document walks you through writing plans in sarsoft and getting information to teams in the field via SAR 104 forms, maps, and GPS downloads.

= Creating a new Search =

Starting at the home page, enter a name for your search, a password if desired, and some descriptive text about the first operational period:

The next page you'll land on is the home page, which although it has links to all of sarsoft's functionality, doesn't actually let you do anything.  Click "Map" next to "Current Operations:" to go to the operational period map view, the real hub of plans writing in sarsoft:

= Initializing the Map =

The map view starts out with a picture of the entire US.  Using the pan and zoom controls or by double-clicking, zoom in on the missing person's last known point (LKP).  You can adjust the map background using controls in the upper right, either by adjusting the background only, or by blending a background and an overlay layer with an opacity from 0-100.

When you've zoomed in, right-click on the map and select "Set LKP here".

You should now see a red dot surrounded by range rings at 500m, 1km and 1.5km.  You can control these by right-clicking on the map, selecting "Map Setup" and entering your own values at the bottom of the dialog window.  When you've selected appropriate range rings and the best map background to represent the search, right-click on the map and select "Make this map background default for search".  Sarsoft will now remember these selections on future map views.

= Creating and Editing Assignments =

To write your first assignment, right-click on the map and select "New Search Assignment".

In the Create Assignment dialog that comes up, enter an assignment number (leave blank to autofill), check the Area Assignment box to indicate whether the assignment covers a wide area (checked) or a single path from A to B (unchecked), and enter the other information if known.

You should see a box or line on the screen, depending on whether it was an area assignment.  Right-click the box and select "Edit Assignment Bounds".

The vertexes and midpoints of the assignment are now draggable; drag them into the shape of the assignment and then right-click and choose "Save Changes".

Keep doing this to create other assignments.  Some pointers:
 * Sarsoft will automatically update your map as others create or modify assignments in their own browsers.  This makes it easy to split the work up across multiple computers.
 * If the map gets cluttered, you can choose to only show assignments of a certain type (ground, dog, etc).  Right-click on the map, select "Map Setup", and on the first dropdown ("Show"), select the type you want to display.
 * If you're creating duplicate ground and dog assignments, you can clone an assignment by right-clicking on it.

When you're done, right-click on the map and choose "Return to Operational Period 1".

= Modifying and Printing an Individual Assignment =

You can get to an individual assignment's detail page from the home page (select an assignment #, click GO), from the operational period list view page (by clicking on the table), or from the map view (right-click an assignment, select "View Assignment Details").

You can update an assignment's details by entering information and clicking "Save Changes", but in order to change the assignment's coordinates, you must use the operational-period-wide map view.

Before you can print an assignment, you have to prepare it.  Preparing an assignment doesn't do much other than signal to sarsoft that the assignment is done being edited, so that that it can enforce some sort of lifecycle management and prevent someone from accidentally printing a half-finished assignment.  Click "Prepare Assignment" and enter your name:

You can now print the SAR 104 forms and maps.
